      The scene backstage last November at the American Music Awards, that
      annual gathering of pop perennials and idiosyncratic arrivistes, was
      carnivalesque: Niall and Liam of One Direction toddled about trying to
      snap a picture with a selfie stick, while Zayn, their bandmate at the
      time, smoked coolly out of frame; Ne-Yo was there in a leopard-Â­print
      blazer two sizes too small; Lil Wayne was wandering around, alone, wearing
      absurd shoes.

      The Seattle duo that took pop music by storm with their debut album The
      Heist has been relatively quiet over the past two years. Now, after
      getting their personal lives and business affairs in order, Macklemore &
      Ryan Lewis are ready to return with their long-awaited follow-up.

  Warning: Although I'm a critic, I'm obviously a fan. As with all things music,
  opinion is unavoidable, which is why I've included my personal insights to
  hopefully gain your trust. I had just turned 16, my friend's parents were out
  of town and we weren't "up to no good"-we were just sitting around and hanging
  out together when I was shown a song that would forever change my life.
